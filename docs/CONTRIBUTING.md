# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! A short checklist for contributions:

- Fork the repo and create a feature branch named `feat/<short-name>`.
- Follow `CODE_CONVENTION.md` for style and logging.
- Add or update tests in `src/ServerScriptService/Tests` where relevant.
- Open a Pull Request against `main` and describe the change and testing done.

If your change affects documentation, add or update files in `docs/` and link from `docs/README.md`.
