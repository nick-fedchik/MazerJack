# Roadmap

Planned milestones:

- Short term: Station MVP core — Modules + Gateways, CommandModule spawn, gate locking/auto doors, station context tracking (module/gate), and basic tests.
- Mid term: Scanner/Telescope systems, Energy economy, and round balancing.
- Long term: Persistent economy, modular mission generation, and release candidate.

To discuss priorities, open an issue or a draft PR linked to the milestone.
