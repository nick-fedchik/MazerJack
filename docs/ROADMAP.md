# Roadmap

Planned milestones:

- Short term: Implement Station MVP services (StationService, LandingZone, RoundManager), basic tests, and replace direct `print` calls with `Logger` usage.
- Mid term: Scanner/Telescope systems, Energy economy, and round balancing.
- Long term: Persistent economy, modular mission generation, and release candidate.

To discuss priorities, open an issue or a draft PR linked to the milestone.
